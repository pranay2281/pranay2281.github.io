# Investing üìàÔ∏è

With current rates of inflation being ~7.5%, the purchasing power of the US $ is decreasing day by day. The solution to this is investing in the stock market.

The world works on stock market. Its relevance in the economic world is of the highest stature. Stock market has always been my subject of interest. Companies and countries build and break depending on how the stock market performs. My dad being a stockbroker ensured I was well informed and aware about how the stock market works. Both of us frequently discuss different stocks and its probable future. The market has been active for over a hundred years and it is often called a ‚Äònet worth multiplier‚Äô.

Compound interest is often called the 8th wonder of the world and investing works on that principle. Many people still fear to invest in the market. So I want to take my project on those lines. It will be to convince people to invest.

After conducting a survey, it was seen that only 8 out of a 100 people invest in the stock market.
